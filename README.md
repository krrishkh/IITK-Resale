## About The Project

Students and faculty at IIT Kanpur often need to **buy or sell** used **items—cycles, mattresses, lab coats, electronics, and books.** This process is often scattered across various informal social media groups, which can be inefficient and lack security.

IITKReSale solves this by providing a dedicated, secure, and **exclusive platform** for the **campus community.** The core of this security is the mandatory **email verification**, which ensures that only users with a valid **@iitk.ac.in** email address can register, creating a trusted environment for all transactions.


## 🚀 Key Features

> **IITK-Exclusive**: Secure registration flow that only allows users with a valid @iitk.ac.in email address.
> **Email OTP Verification**: Robust user verification using a 6-digit OTP sent via Nodemailer for both registration and "Login with OTP" functionality.
> **Real-Time Chat**: A built-in messaging system using Socket.IO allows buyers and sellers to communicate, negotiate, and arrange meetups instantly.
> **Dynamic Marketplace**: A clean, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS to browse, search, and filter items by category or condition.
> **Personal User Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard for users to manage their items for sale and view all their active chat conversations in one place.
> **Full-Stack Platform**: A complete MERN stack application with a Node.js/Express.js backend API and a modern React.js frontend.
> **Image Uploads**: Users can upload multiple images for their product listings.
